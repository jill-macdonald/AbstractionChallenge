# AbstractionChallenge
    //Concrete class from abstract class ListItem & use in a linked list class to implement a linked list that will
    //add items in order(sorted alphabetically)
    //duplicated items not added
    //rules for adding item:
      //if the head of list is null - head refer to item to be added
      //if item to be added is less than current item in list - add item before current(make previous item refer to this)
      //if item is greater than current - move onto next item and compare again(if not next item - that's where it goes)
    //also need a remove method(remove from list)
